### âœ¨ HarmonyOS Development Treasure Cases! Master "One-Develop-Multi-Deploy" for Banking Finance Apps âœ¨  

Hey there, HarmonyOS developers! Today, I unearthed a goldmine in the official docsâ€”HarmonyOS has hidden so many practical "one-develop-multi-deploy" cases! The implementation scheme for this banking finance app is nothing short of a textbook for cross-device development. I stayed up all night to organize this development guide, guaranteeing you'll exclaim, "So this is how it's done!" after reading.  


### I. Why This Case Deserves a Bookmark?  
This banking finance app perfectly demonstrates how to adapt to phones, tablets, smart screens, and more with a single codebase. The three most stunning tricks are:  
1. **Intelligent pop-ups**: Automatically adjust dialog sizes based on device dimensions  
2. **Fluid layouts**: Lists adapt column counts like transformers  
3. **Column magic**: Seamlessly switch from single-column on mobile to dual-column on PC  


### II. Analysis of Three Core Black Technologies  
#### ðŸŽ¯ Case 1: Shape-Shifting Intelligent Pop-Ups  
**Effect Comparison**:  
- Mobile: 380x620 medium pop-up  
- Tablet: 520x800 large pop-up  
- PC: 600x900 full-screen pop-up  

**Code Essence**:  
```typescript  
// Pop-up size adaptation  
.width(new BreakpointUtil({  
  sm: $r('app.float.dialog_width_sm'),  // Mobile  
  md: $r('app.float.dialog_width_md'),  // Tablet  
  lg: $r('app.float.dialog_width_lg')   // PC  
}).getValue(this.currentPoint))  
```  

**Development Tips**:  
- Use `@StorageProp` to listen for real-time device breakpoint changes  
- Manage pop-up lifecycles with `CustomDialogController`  
- Achieve fluid column layouts via the `lanes` attribute  

#### ðŸŒŸ Case 2: List Transformation  
**Column Changes**:  
- Mobile: 2 columns â†’ Tablet: 3 columns â†’ PC: 5 columns  

**Code Demonstration**:  
```typescript  
// Dynamically load different data quantities  
ForEach(new BreakpointUtil({  
  sm: getFundData(0,5),    // Load 5 items for mobile  
  md: getFundData(0,8),    // Load 8 items for tablet  
  lg: getFundData(0,12)    // Load 12 items for PC  
}), (item)=>{...})  
```  

**Layout Secrets**:  
```typescript  
.lanes({  // Dynamic column setting  
  sm: 2,  
  md: 3,  
  lg: 5  
}, $r('app.float.list_space'))  // Adaptive spacing  
```  

#### ðŸ’¡ Case 3: The 72 Transformations of Column Layouts  
**Mode Switching**:  
- Small screens: `Stack` mode (single-column stacking)  
- Large screens: `Split` mode (dual-column side-by-side)  

**Core Code**:  
```typescript  
.mode(this.breakPoint === 'lg' ?  
  NavigationMode.Split :  // Column mode  
  NavigationMode.Stack)  // Stack mode  
```  

**Navigation Bar Adaptation**:  
```typescript  
.navBarWidth('30%')  // Fixed sidebar proportion  
.hideTitleBar(true)  // Hide title bar on large screens  
```  


### III. More Battle-Tested Tips  
1. **Responsive images**: Use `Image.objectFit(ImageFit.Contain)` for adaptive scaling  
2. **Gesture interaction**: Recognize left-right swipes to switch products via `PanGesture`  
3. **Data synchronization**: Achieve cross-device state sync with `@StorageLink`  
4. **Animationè¡”æŽ¥ (Transition)**: Use `animateTo` for smooth column expansion animations  


### V. Heart-to-Heart Talk  
When I first started with "one-develop-multi-deploy" development, I was overwhelmed by breakpoint adaptations. But after practicing with these official cases, I realized HarmonyOS had already paved the way for us. I recommend digging for treasures in the developer communityâ€”many issues have already been solved by predecessors.  

If there's a specific industry case you'd like to see next, leave a comment! The next issue might feature hardcore breakdowns of "smart home" or "in-vehicle applications"â€”you decide!  

Finally, a word of advice: Great code isn't just written; it's "copied"â€”of course, referring to excellent official cases! ðŸŽ‰
